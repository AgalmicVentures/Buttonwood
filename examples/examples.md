# Introduction

The `examples` folder contains a series of examples to help you get started with Buttonwood. Buttonwood is a collection of the components you need to rapidly build, test, and analyze markets/market structures/etc. It is meant to be flexible. It is object oriented so you can extend it as you wish. Thus, these examples are not intended to be comprehensive. Rather, they are intended to be a helpful guide to working with Buttonwood and understanding how its components go together.

# Examples

## CSV to Events
Folder: `CSVtoEvents`

To analyze markets you need to start with the market's most important data objects: Order Events. Your source might be a database or flat files or a web service. And most likely they won't be in the same format as what are used here. But this example should help you see how take raw data and create order events.
